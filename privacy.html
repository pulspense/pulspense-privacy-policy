    <h1>Privacy Policy for PulsPense</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 21, 2025</p>

    <p>We built PulsPense with your financial well-being and privacy at its core. We believe managing your expenses should be simple, secure, and entirely within your control. That's why this privacy policy is as straightforward as our app: we don't collect your personal financial data.</p>

    <h2>What Information We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>It's simple: we don't collect, store, or transmit any of your personal spending data, financial transactions, account information, or any other details you input into the app.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your spending data stays on your device. It's never sent to our servers or any third party.</li>
        <li>We don't track your usage patterns. We're focused on helping you track your money, not on tracking you.</li>
        <li>We don't ask for your personal identifiers like name, email, or phone number to use the core features of the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Information We Might Collect (Very Limited)</h2>
    <p>To ensure the app runs smoothly and we can fix any issues, we may collect anonymous, non-identifiable technical data. This could include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash logs:</strong> If the app crashes, we might receive an anonymous report about the crash to help us understand and fix bugs. These reports do not contain any of your personal financial data.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic device information:</strong> Such as your operating system version or device model, again, solely for troubleshooting and app improvement. This information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used purely for app improvement and stability. It helps us make the app better for everyone without ever compromising your personal financial privacy.</p>

    <h2>How Your Data is Used (It's Not!)</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect your personal financial data, there's nothing for us to use, share, or sell. Your expense lists, charts, and PDF reports are generated and stored locally on your device. You have complete control over them.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Because your financial data resides only on your device, it's secured by your device's own security features (like passcodes, biometrics, etc.). We encourage you to use these features to protect your device and the data on it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by updating the 'Last Updated' date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:pulspensehelpdesk@gmail.com" class="contact-email">pulspensehelpdesk@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p class="final-statement">Your financial privacy is our priority. Spend smart, worry less.</p>
